# Learning NodeJs
## Intro
*As a front-end engineer, the only part used to be familiar to me in NodeJs is constructing web server with Express. And recently I find it important and interesting to take a deep dive into the language itself. So I created this repository to collect NodeJs tutorial resource and take notes during studying.*

## Basic
Thanks for [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list). We can find all kinds of related resources needed. At this phase, I plan to get more info about base feature of NodeJs such as async I/O, http, stream and so on.
