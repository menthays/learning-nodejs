### Summary
**learnyounode** contains 13 exercises, easy but useful. Mostly you can figure out the answer just by the hint for the problem. It covers file I/O, http/tcp server, stream operation, commandline arg, async operation... 

Remember you do not always need to follow the hint since it was written long time ago. Such as exercise 9 -- Juggling Async, use async/await maybe more easier to include a third-party library.
